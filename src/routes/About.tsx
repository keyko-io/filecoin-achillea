              Filecoin Plus is a layer of social trust on top of the Filecoin
              Network to help incentivize the storage of real data. Root
              key-holders, notaries, clients, and storage providers, interact
              through the allocation and spending of DataCap. You can read more
              about the Fil+ program here.
            </p>
            <p className="pt-4 text-[15px]">
              Clients looking to utilize storage on the network apply to receive
              DataCap from Notaries, which can be used to incentivize storage
              providers to make storage deals. Notaries are community-elected
              trustees responsible for allocating DataCap to parties storing
              useful data on the network. Storage Providers that receive DataCap
              receive a 10x boost to their quality-adjusted power for the
              storage space offered in that deal, which increases their block
              reward share in the network. This creates a mechanism that
              incentivizes all participants to make Filecoin more useful.
